  <h1>My Love for Photography</h1>
<p>
  Photography is one of my favourite hobbies because it lets me capture moments
  and turn them into lasting memories. Whether I'm taking pictures of nature,
  people, or city landscapes, each photo tells its own story. I enjoy exploring
  new places, learning about lighting, and experimenting with different angles.
  Over time, photography has helped me appreciate the small details in everyday
  life. It's a creative outlet that brings me joy and encourages me to see the
  world in new ways.
